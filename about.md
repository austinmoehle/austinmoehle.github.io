A machine learning enthusiast interested in applying deep learning to computer vision and audio recognition. From 2013 to 2016 I was a graduate researcher in the Fuchs Group at Cornell University, contributing to work on the electrical conductivity of the [radical polymer PTMA](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/tc/2018/c7tc04645f#!divAbstract), which was investigated for organic battery applications, and the [spin physics of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5325). 

I received an M.S. in physics from Cornell University in 2016 and a B.S. in physics from Caltech in 2012.
